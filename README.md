To solve these problems, we have come up with the solution(s). We have created a website and the name of our website is City Plus. The city plus website solves several problems related to emergency medical services and patient care. On this website, we have included four options they are: pharmaceuticals, hospital to hospital, doctor appointment, and blood bank.
Pharmaceuticals: if the user is not able to get the required medicine in the hospital where he is being treated, in this option he will be able to get information about the availability of the required medicines. In this way, he will not waste his time searching for medicines by visiting the nearby hospitals.
Hospital to hospital:  when the patient had to be transferred to another hospital, in this option the user will be able to get the information about availability of beds, OPD. So that in case of an emergency, the patient will be able to get the treatment on time by avoiding the visit of hospitals where there are no beds, etc.
Doctor appointment: here the patients will be able to make an appointment with the doctor. They will be able to make the appointments based on their schedule since they will know which doctors are available during that time.
Blood bank: here the user will get to know the availability of the required blood and also will be able to donate the blood for the person in need. In case of an emergency, the patient will receive the blood on time and thus it will increase his chances of survival.
